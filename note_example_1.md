CHIEF COMPLAINT: 6-month follow-up, medication management.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia here for a scheduled follow-up. He reports good adherence to his medications (Lisinopril and Atorvastatin). His home blood pressure log shows readings consistently in the 120s/70s.

He notes his sleep has been poor for the last month. He states he feels "on edge" and has "constant worry" about his wife's recent health scare. This has led to him feeling jittery during the day and having difficulty concentrating at work. He denies any episodes of shortness of breath or chest pain associated with these feelings. He does not feel he's had a "panic attack" but is concerned about his level of nervousness.

When asked about general well-being, he states his energy is "a bit low," which he attributes to the poor sleep. He denies any specific aches or soreness. He is still active, walking his dog 30 minutes daily, and has no physical limitations. He explicitly denies any back soreness or joint discomfort.
