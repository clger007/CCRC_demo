I am providing you with two pieces of information:

1. **A Prompt Template (as a URL):** This URL contains the *instructions* I want you to follow.
   https://github.com/clger007/CCRC_demo/blob/main/prompt_final.md

2. **An Input Note (as text):** This is the text I want you to analyze.
   https://github.com/clger007/CCRC_demo/blob/main/note_example_1.md

**Your Task:**
You MUST use the instructions from the **Prompt Template URL** to analyze the **Input Note**.

**DO NOT** describe or summarize the prompt template. Just execute it on the note.

**Output Format:**
Show a complete view for the audience:
1. Display the **original clinical note** in full.
2. Then, clearly label and display the **final JSON result** underneath.

Example Output:
---
**Original Note:**
<full note text here>

**Result:**
{
  "anxiety": "...",
  "depression": "...",
  "pain": "..."
} Limit your answer to only these three information extraction.
